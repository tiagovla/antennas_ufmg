# Antennas Lab - UFMG - 2019/02

Why should you use python?
* [Advantages and disadvantages](https://medium.com/@mindfiresolutions.usa/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-python-programming-language-fd0b394f2121)
* [Most popular languages](https://stackify.com/popular-programming-languages-2018/)
* [Data science and machine learning](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/05/poll-top-data-science-machine-learning-platforms.html)

Where can you learn python?
* The main source is always the [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
* There are also courses like [sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/), [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/topic/python/), [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com), ...
* Youtube channels
* Once you know the basics, [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [google](https://www.google.com/) are your best bets.

Usually, the [4NEC2](https://www.qsl.net/4nec2/) can be used to simulate antennas, but its GUI is limited. Then, using a wrapper interface to communicate with the NEC engine is the best solution. There are wrapper interfaces for several languages, amongst them:
* [PyNEC](https://github.com/tmolteno/python-necpp/tree/master/PyNEC) for python 
* [necpp](https://github.com/tmolteno/python-necpp) for c++

## What do you need to run the examples in this repository?
* 4NEC2: https://www.qsl.net/4nec2/
* Python 3.X: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* PyNEC: https://github.com/tmolteno/python-necpp/tree/master/PyNEC [`pip3 install pynec`]
* Numpy: https://numpy.org/ [`pip3 install numpy`]
* Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/ [`pip3 install matplotlib`]
